## Brief Overview
This planning package defines how to make the top-level orchestrator clarify requirements with ralph-plan-like rigor while continuing to delegate work continuously. It also defines v1 race-condition prevention using the selected Option C model: task ownership declarations plus mandatory write-time per-file locks.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Implement Step 1 and Step 2 first to enforce clarification quality and phase gating.
2. Implement Step 3 through Step 6 to introduce locking safely without breaking current task lifecycle behavior.
3. Run Step 7 and Step 8 validation to confirm prompt contracts, lock behavior, blocker routing, and end-to-end orchestration flow.
