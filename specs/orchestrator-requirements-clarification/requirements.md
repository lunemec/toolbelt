> Archival note: This spec package records the pre-extraction in-repo coordinator model. The authoritative coordinator implementation now lives in the standalone `/workspace/coordinator` repository.

Q1: What exact behavior should the top-level orchestrator follow for requirement clarification (for example: ask one question at a time, gate progress on explicit confirmation, and write updates to spec files), and what should be different from the current behavior?

A1: The top-level orchestrator should behave basically exactly like ralph plan. Current behavior does not ask for detailed enough specifications, leading to suboptimal results.

Q2: In your context, what are the must-have outputs of a successful clarification session (for example: finalized requirements document, explicit acceptance criteria, implementation plan outline, risk list), and which of these are non-negotiable?

A2: The non-negotiable output is planned tasks for specialist subagents based on the coordination folder structure in this repository.

Q3: Should the orchestrator create those specialist tasks only after explicit user approval of clarified requirements, or continuously during clarification as new details emerge?

A3: The orchestrator should create specialist tasks continuously during clarification, and it should use specialist outputs to discover new details, requirements, and follow-up clarification questions for the user.

Q4: Which specialist agents should the top-level orchestrator actively delegate to by default (for example: architect, researcher, reviewer, implementer), and are there any it must never auto-delegate without user confirmation?

A4: Delegate to whichever specialist agents are necessary for the task, and the orchestrator may create new specialists when useful.

Q5: What guardrails should apply when auto-creating or auto-delegating specialists (for example: required naming convention, max parallel agents, mandatory user approval for high-impact actions, budget/time limits)?

A5: The only required guardrails are to prevent race conditions where same or different agents modify the same files.

Q6: How should file-level conflict prevention work in practice (for example: per-file locking, per-directory ownership windows, branch-per-agent with merge arbitration), and where should lock state be recorded?

A6: User asked for suggestions for the first-version conflict-prevention approach.

Q7: For v1, which lock model do you want?
- Option A: Per-file lock files in `coordination/locks/files/<path>.lock` (max safety, more lock operations).
- Option B: Per-task declared file ownership in task frontmatter (simpler, relies on accurate declarations).
- Option C: Hybrid: per-task ownership + mandatory per-file lock only at write time (balanced default).

A7: Option C selected for v1 (hybrid): per-task ownership declarations + mandatory per-file lock at write time.

Q8: Should the top-level agent enforce a strict "one question at a time" clarification loop with explicit user confirmation before phase changes (mirroring ralph-plan style), even when specialists are running in parallel?

A8: Yes, enforce strict one-question-at-a-time clarification with explicit user confirmation before phase changes, even when specialists run in parallel.

Q9: What exact completion condition should end clarification and transition to finalized planning artifacts (for example: user explicitly says "requirements complete" and no open blocker tasks remain)?

A9: Completion condition accepted: clarification ends when the user explicitly confirms requirements are complete and there are no open blocker tasks.

Q10: Are requirements clarification complete for this effort?

A10: Yes, requirements clarification is complete.
